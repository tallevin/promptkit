# promptkit

A version-controlled home for my AI **system prompts**, **domain extensions**, working prompts, and the docs that keep everything clear and reusable.

## üß© Prompt architecture

| Layer | Role | File path |
|-------|------|-----------|
| **Universal Core Foundation** | Baseline ‚Äúoperating system‚Äù that defines objectives, thinking principles, behavioural rules, comms rules, system rules, and response architecture. | [`templates/universal-core-foundation-v1.1.md`](templates/system/universal-core-foundation.md) |
| **Domain Extensions** | Add-on templates that *supplement or override* the baseline for a specific role (e.g. Creative Strategist, Future Trend Forecaster, Synthetic Strategist). | [`templates/extensions/`](templates/extensions/) |
| **Working Prompts** | Project-specific or task-specific prompts that import the Core + relevant Extension and add any situational tweaks. | [`prompts/`](prompts/) |

**Working theory**

1. **Single Source of Truth** ‚Äì The Universal Core Foundation is edited *in-place* and version-tagged. Everything inherits from it, so one change propagates everywhere.  
2. **Composable Overlays** ‚Äì Extensions are opt-in overlays. They declare **only** what they add or override, keeping inheritance explicit and debuggable.  
3. **Copy-to-Create** ‚Äì New prompts start by copying a template, then trimming or augmenting. This enforces consistent front-matter and section ordering.  
4. **Version Tags as APIs** ‚Äì Core and Extension files are tagged (`v1.1`, `v1.2`). Projects can pin to a tag for stability while upstream evolves.

## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow conventions

| Guideline | Why |
| ---------- | --- |
| **Branches:** `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `chore/` | Keeps commit history readable via Conventional Commits. |
| **PRs for everything** | Guarantees review‚Äîeven when working solo. |
| **Tags = versions** | Tag every merge that changes a system or extension template. |
| **Single-source-of-truth** | Iterate in-place; copy files only for breaking rewrites (`v2.x`). |
| **One prompt ‚â† many prompts** | Each prompt lives in its own file for granular diffs. |
